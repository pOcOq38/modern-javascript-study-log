## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, versatile programming language used mainly for interactive web development. It runs in browsers and on servers (Node.js), enabling dynamic features and event-driven programming.

## Variables

Variables store data values. In ES6+, `let` and `const` are preferred over `var` for block scoping and immutability control.

## Operators

Operators perform operations on values. Categories include arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, and ternary operators.

## Control Statements

Control the flow of a program using conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`) and loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).

## Functions

Functions encapsulate reusable logic. ES6 introduces arrow functions and default/rest parameters for cleaner syntax.

## Objects / Complex Data

Objects store key-value pairs. They allow grouping of related data and methods. Complex data structures include nested objects and arrays.

## Classes

Classes provide a blueprint for creating objects with shared properties and methods. ES6 class syntax simplifies object-oriented programming.

## Useful Built-in Objects

JavaScript provides built-in objects like `Math`, `Date`, `JSON`, and `RegExp` for common tasks.

## Arrays

Arrays store ordered collections of values. ES6 introduces new methods like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and spread syntax.

## Iterables / Generators

Iterables are objects that can be looped over (e.g., arrays, strings). Generators (`function*`) allow producing values lazily on demand.

## Map / Set

`Map` stores key-value pairs with any type as keys. `Set` stores unique values and prevents duplicates.

## Comments / Error Handling / Modules

- **Comments:** `//` for single-line, `/* */` for multi-line.
- **Error Handling:** `try`, `catch`, `finally`, and `throw` for managing exceptions.
- **Modules:** `export` and `import` for organizing code.

## Asynchronous Programming

Handle operations that take time (like network requests) using callbacks, Promises, and `async/await`.

## Scope

Scope determines the accessibility of variables. ES6 introduces block scope with `let` and `const`.

## Prototypes

Every object has a prototype from which it can inherit properties and methods.

## Closures

Closures allow functions to access variables from their outer scope, even after that scope has finished executing.

## this

`this` refers to the context in which a function is called. Its behavior varies depending on how a function is invoked.

## Babel Overview

Babel is a JavaScript compiler that converts modern ES6+ code into backward-compatible JavaScript for older browsers.
